# goodpractice 1.0.3

Additions:

* Limit for cyclomatic complexity check can be adjusted using the `goodpractice.cyclocomp.limit` option, default 50 (#132, @fabian-s).
* The number of lines printed to the console by each check result can be set using the new `positions_limit` parameter into `print()` - previously it was always 5 lines (#130, @fabian-s).
* GitHub Actions now used for CI/CD checks (#145), as well as to calculate code coverage with {covr} and build the package site with {pkgdown}.



Bugfixes:

* Documentation for custom checks significantly improved (#133, @fabian-s).
